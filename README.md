# AbuseIPDB v4.0.0 for Zen Cart 2.1.0 or later

## Prerequisites

- Zen Cart 2.1.0 or later
- PHP 7.4+ (recommended: PHP 8.x)

## ABOUT THIS MODULE

This module is an AbuseIPDB integration for Zen Cart, designed to help protect your e-commerce website from abusive IP addresses. It checks the confidence score of a visitor's IP address using the AbuseIPDB API and blocks access to the site if the score exceeds a predefined threshold.
The module supports caching to reduce the number of API calls, test mode for debugging, logging for monitoring blocked IPs, and a range of new flood protection features based on IP prefixes and country-level analysis.
Additionally, it allows manual whitelisting, blacklisting, and country blocking to give you even greater control over access to your site.

**Major Update Notice:**
If you are upgrading from v3.0.4 or earlier, you must uninstall the previous module before installing v4.0.0.  
‚ö° Important: Be sure to screen-capture your existing settings before uninstalling AbuseIPDB **v3.0.4 or lower** to preserve your configuration.

## INSTALLATION AND UPGRADE

Before you start ‚Ä¶

If you are upgrading from a version below v3.0.0, please note that earlier versions of this plugin did not use Zen Cart's Encapsulated Plugins system. Starting with v3.0.0, the plugin has been fully transitioned to this modern framework, and outdated files from earlier versions will be automatically removed during installation.

Important: The following legacy files are automatically removed when v3.0.0 or later is installed:

``` text

## THINGS TO KNOW

1. **API Key Setup**  
    - The script requires a valid API key from AbuseIPDB to check the abuse confidence score of an IP address.  
    - Ensure that a valid API key is available and correctly configured in the **"AbuseIPDB API Key"** setting in the Zen Cart admin panel.  
    - Be sure to [verify yourself](https://www.abuseipdb.com/account/webmasters) as the owner of your domain in the AbuseIPDB Webmasters section to increase your daily free API call limit from 1000 to 3000.  

    **How to Obtain an API Key**:  
    - Visit [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com) and sign up for an account.  
    - Once registered, log in and navigate to the **API Key** section in your account dashboard.  
    - Generate an API key and copy it into the **"AbuseIPDB API Key"** setting in the Zen Cart admin panel.

    **Boost AbuseIPDB API Limits**  
    - Added a new widget to help boost the limits of the AbuseIPDB API.  
    - With this, you can increase the `check & report` limits to **5,000 per day** instead of the usual **1,000** or **3,000** available on the free tier.  
    - The widget sits unobtrusively on your admin backend landing page.  

	**Widget Configuration Steps**:

	- To integrate the (optional) AbuseIPDB dashboard widget, follow these steps:
		- You will need your profile ID number, which can be found in the **Account Summary** section of AbuseIPDB.  
		- Obtain your profile ID by visiting the [Contributors Badge](https://www.abuseipdb.com/account/contributor) section of the AbuseIPDB dashboard.
		- After logging in, locate the HTML block in the Contributors Badge section. Look carefully for an `<a>` tag, which will contain a line like this:  
		`<a href="https://www.abuseipdb.com/user/XXXXXX" title="AbuseIPDB is an IP address blacklist for webmasters and sysadmins to report IP addresses engaging in abusive behavior on their networks">`.  
		The `XXXXXX` in the URL is your Member ID. (**Note**: This is different from your API Key, which is required to activate the module.)
		- Once you have your Member ID, navigate to **Configuration > AbuseIPDB Settings** in the ZenCart admin area.
		- Locate the configuration setting labeled "AbuseIPDB: User ID."
		- Enter only the numeric Member ID obtained earlier.
		- Now find the setting **Enable Admin Widget?** - Set this to **true** which will enable the widget to display on your Admin Dashboard and, if configured correctly, grant you the role of `Supporter`, boosting your ability to report back to AbuseIPDB.
		- To disable the widget, set **Enable Admin Widget?** back to **false**. Note doing this may result in losing the **Supporter** role.

2. Cache Expiry: The script checks the database cache to avoid excessive API calls. If the cache for a specific IP address has expired, the script makes a new API call.  
3. Test Mode: The script provides a test mode for debugging. When an IP is in test mode, the script logs the IP as blocked regardless of the abuse score.  
4. IP Cleanup Feature: The module has an IP Cleanup feature that automatically deletes expired IP records. The cleanup process is triggered once per day by the first logged IP. This functionality can be enabled or disabled, and the IP record expiration period can be configured in the settings "IP Cleanup Period (in days)".  
5. Manual Whitelisting and Blacklisting: The script checks if an IP is manually whitelisted or blacklisted before it does anything else. Manually whitelisted IPs will bypass the AbuseIPDB check, and manually blacklisted IPs will be immediately blocked. Enter the IP addresses separated by commas without any spaces, like this: `192.168.1.1,192.168.2.2,192.168.3.3`.
6. Additional IP Blacklist File Option: The module offers an advanced IP blacklist feature. Administrators can enable or disable this functionality through the "Enable IP Blacklist File?" setting in the Zen Cart admin panel. Once enabled, the module examines a designated blacklist file for every incoming IP address. The blacklist file should list one complete or partial IP address per line. If there is a match, the corresponding IP will be promptly blocked, bypassing any other checks or scoring methods. This feature provides administrators with enhanced control over blocking specific IP addresses by utilizing complete or partial matches from the blacklist file.    
7. Logging: If logging is enabled, log files are created when an IP is blocked, whether manually or based on the AbuseIPDB score. If API logging is enabled, a separate log file is also created for API calls. The location of these log files can be configured in the `ABUSEIPDB_LOG_FILE_PATH` setting in the Zen Cart admin panel.  
8. Skipping IP Check for Known Spiders: If the "Allow Spiders?" setting (`ABUSEIPDB_SPIDER_ALLOW`) is enabled, known spiders will be skipped in the IP check and logging process, as they are not subject to AbuseIPDB scoring. This can be useful for avoiding unnecessary API calls and log entries for spider sessions.  
9. Spider Detection: The script utilizes a file called `spiders.txt` provided by Zen Cart to identify known spiders, including search engine bots and web crawlers. It reads the user agent from the HTTP request and compares it against the entries in the spiders.txt file. If a match is found, indicating that the user agent corresponds to a known spider, the spider flag is set to true. This flag determines the script's behavior, enabling it to bypass certain checks or execute specific actions tailored for spider sessions.  

10. **Enhanced "Who's Online" Page Features**  
    - Real-Time Threat Assessment: Displays AbuseIPDB confidence scores for each visitor, enabling real-time assessment of potential threats. Clicking on a score redirects to the AbuseIPDB website for detailed information about the IP address.  
    - Interactive IP Status Icons:  
        - üõ°Ô∏è **Red Shield**: Indicates a blocked IP.  
        - üö´ **Grey Circle with Slash**: Indicates an unblocked IP.  
      These icons allow quick manual addition of IPs to the blacklist file directly from the "Who's Online" screen.  

    **Requirements for "Who's Online" Features**  
    - The **"Enable IP Blacklist File"** setting must be set to **true** in the configuration.  
    - Ensure the optional files `blacklist.txt` and `whos_online.php` are uploaded to activate these features.  

11. **Flood Tracking and Flood Blocking (NEW!)**  
    - The module now tracks IP hits based on:
      - 2-octet prefixes (e.g., `192.168`)
      - 3-octet prefixes (e.g., `192.168.1`)
      - Country codes (e.g., `US`, `VN`)
    - If the number of hits from a prefix or country exceeds a configurable threshold, automatic blocking will occur.
    - Country and foreign (non-home country) floods are handled separately with their own thresholds for maximum flexibility.
    - Administrators can now manually block entire countries via configuration settings.

12. **Foreign Country Flood Detection (NEW!)**  
    - You can separately monitor "foreign" traffic ‚Äî meaning traffic originating outside your store‚Äôs configured home country.
    - If hits from a foreign country exceed the configured threshold, blocking will occur automatically.

13. **Manual Country Blocking (NEW!)**  
    - Administrators can manually specify a list of country codes to instantly block (e.g., `VN,CN,RU`) without waiting for AbuseIPDB scores or flood detection to trigger.
    - Supports both proactive (manual) and reactive (automatic) defense strategies.

14. **Score-Safe Flood Logic**  
    - Even if flood thresholds are crossed, an IP must meet a minimum AbuseIPDB score before blocking occurs.
    - Ensures legitimate customers are not accidentally blocked during sudden spikes in real traffic (e.g., newsletters, sales).

15. **Automatic API Usage Failsafe**  
    - If the AbuseIPDB API quota is exceeded, API calls will fail gracefully.
    - IP scores of `-1` are treated as neutral and **will not** trigger flood or country blocking ‚Äî keeping your site accessible even when the API is unavailable.

16. **Expanded Admin Settings**  
    - New settings added:
      - Foreign Flood Threshold
      - Minimum Score for Country Flood Blocking
      - Manual Blocked Country List
    - Provides fine-grained control over flood detection, country-level blocking, and API safety margins.

## SCRIPT LOGIC

This section provides an understanding of the logic steps involved in checking an IP and creating the corresponding log files:  

1. IP Whitelisting: The script first checks if the IP is whitelisted. If it is, the IP is permitted without further processing.  
2. Manual IP Blocking: If the IP is not whitelisted, the script checks if the IP is manually blocked. If it is, the IP address is logged as blocked in the cache and a corresponding log file is generated. The log file creation details are as follows:  
    - File Name: `abuseipdb_blocked_cache_<date>.log`
    - Location: `ABUSEIPDB_LOG_FILE_PATH`
3. IP Cache Lookup: If the IP is neither whitelisted nor manually blocked, the script then looks for the IP in the database cache.  
    - a. If the IP is found in the cache and the cache has not expired: 
      - The abuse score is retrieved from the cache. 
      - If the abuse score is above the threshold or the IP is in test mode, the IP is logged as blocked in the cache and a log file is created with the same details as described above.
    - b. If the IP is not found in the cache or the cache has expired: - An API call is made to AbuseIPDB to fetch the abuse score for the IP. - The database cache is then updated with the new abuse score and timestamp.  
    - c. Skip IP check for known spiders: If the IP is identified as a known spider and the ABUSEIPDB_SPIDER_ALLOW setting is enabled, the IP check and logging steps are skipped for spiders.  
    - d. Spider Logging: If Spider logging is enabled, a separate log file for spiders that bypassed an ip check is created.  
4. **Flood Tracking and Flood Blocking (NEW!)**: After an IP is cached or updated, the system automatically tracks hits against:
    - 2-octet prefixes (e.g., `192.168`)
    - 3-octet prefixes (e.g., `192.168.1`)
    - Country codes (e.g., `US`, `VN`)

    Additional behavior:
    - If hits from a prefix or country exceed the configured thresholds, the visitor may be automatically blocked (even if their AbuseIPDB score is low).
    - Separate Foreign Country Flood Detection monitors traffic from countries other than the store's Default Country.
    - Manual Country Blocking allows specifying country codes (e.g., `VN,CN,RU`) that are always blocked without needing score checks.
    - Score-Safe Rule: Even if a flood is detected, an IP will only be blocked if it meets the configured Minimum Score for Flood Blocking.
    - API Fail-Safe: If AbuseIPDB API calls are exhausted and return `-1` scores, flood or country blocking will not trigger ‚Äî ensuring legitimate traffic is not mistakenly locked out.
5. Database Cleanup: The script's function periodically removes old IP records from the database when triggered, if the cleanup feature is enabled. This operation is performed only once per day, as indicated by the update of the maintenance timestamp.  
6. API Logging: If API logging is enabled, a separate log file for API calls is created. The log file creation details are as follows:  
    - File Name: `abuseipdb_api_call_date.log`
    - Location: `ABUSEIPDB_LOG_FILE_PATH`  
7. IP Blocking: If the abuse score is above the threshold or the IP is in test mode, the IP address is logged as blocked (either from the API call or from the cache) and a corresponding log file is created. The log file creation details are as follows:  
    - File Name: `abuseipdb_blocked_date.log`
    - Location: `ABUSEIPDB_LOG_FILE_PATH`
8. Safe IP: If none of the above conditions trigger a block, the IP is considered safe, and the script proceeds without further action.
