# AbuseIPDB v4.0.6 for Zen Cart 2.1.0 or later

## Prerequisites

- Zen Cart 2.1.0 or later
- PHP 7.4+ (recommended: PHP 8.x)

## ABOUT THIS MODULE

This module is an AbuseIPDB integration for Zen Cart, designed to protect your e-commerce website from abusive IP addresses. It checks the confidence score of a visitor's IP address using the AbuseIPDB API and blocks access if the score exceeds a predefined threshold.  
The module supports caching with extended duration for high-scoring IPs to optimize API calls, test mode for debugging, logging for monitoring blocked IPs, and advanced flood protection based on IP prefixes and country-level analysis.  
Additionally, it offers manual whitelisting, blacklisting, country blocking, and session rate limiting‚Äînow enhanced with a queuing mechanism using the `abuseipdb_actions` table for improved reliability and reduced `.htaccess` write delays‚Äîproviding precise control over site access.

## INSTALLATION AND UPGRADE

Before you start ‚Ä¶

If you are upgrading from a version below v3.0.0, please note that earlier versions of this plugin did not use Zen Cart's Encapsulated Plugins system. Starting with v3.0.0, the plugin has been fully transitioned to this modern framework, and outdated files from earlier versions will be automatically removed during installation.

Important: The following legacy files are automatically removed when v3.0.0 or later is installed:

``` text
/YOUR_ADMIN/includes/auto_loaders/config.abuseipdb_admin.php
/YOUR_ADMIN/includes/extra_datafiles/abuseipdb_settings.php
/YOUR_ADMIN/includes/init_includes/init_abuseipdb_observer.php
/YOUR_ADMIN/includes/english/extra_definitions/abuseipdb_admin_names.php

## THINGS TO KNOW

1. **API Key Setup**  
    - The script requires a valid API key from AbuseIPDB to check the abuse confidence score of an IP address.  
    - Ensure that a valid API key is available and correctly configured in the **"AbuseIPDB API Key"** setting in the Zen Cart admin panel.  
    - Be sure to [verify yourself](https://www.abuseipdb.com/account/webmasters) as the owner of your domain in the AbuseIPDB Webmasters section to increase your daily free API call limit from 1000 to 3000.  

    **How to Obtain an API Key**:  
    - Visit [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com) and sign up for an account.  
    - Once registered, log in and navigate to the **API Key** section in your account dashboard.  
    - Generate an API key and copy it into the **"AbuseIPDB API Key"** setting in the Zen Cart admin panel.

    **Boost AbuseIPDB API Limits**  
    - Added a new widget to help boost the limits of the AbuseIPDB API.  
    - With this, you can increase the `check & report` limits to **5,000 per day** instead of the usual **1,000** or **3,000** available on the free tier.  
    - The widget sits unobtrusively on your admin backend landing page.  

	**Widget Configuration Steps**:

	- To integrate the (optional) AbuseIPDB dashboard widget, follow these steps:
		- You will need your profile ID number, which can be found in the **Account Summary** section of AbuseIPDB.  
		- Obtain your profile ID by visiting the [Contributors Badge](https://www.abuseipdb.com/account/contributor) section of the AbuseIPDB dashboard.
		- After logging in, locate the HTML block in the Contributors Badge section. Look carefully for an `<a>` tag, which will contain a line like this:  
		`<a href="https://www.abuseipdb.com/user/XXXXXX" title="AbuseIPDB is an IP address blacklist for webmasters and sysadmins to report IP addresses engaging in abusive behavior on their networks">`.  
		The `XXXXXX` in the URL is your Member ID. (**Note**: This is different from your API Key, which is required to activate the module.)
		- Once you have your Member ID, navigate to **Configuration > AbuseIPDB Settings** in the ZenCart admin area.
		- Locate the configuration setting labeled "AbuseIPDB: User ID."
		- Enter only the numeric Member ID obtained earlier.
		- Now find the setting **Enable Admin Widget?** - Set this to **true** which will enable the widget to display on your Admin Dashboard and, if configured correctly, grant you the role of `Supporter`, boosting your ability to report back to AbuseIPDB.
		- To disable the widget, set **Enable Admin Widget?** back to **false**. Note doing this may result in losing the **Supporter** role.

2. Cache Expiry: The script checks the database cache to avoid excessive API calls. If the cache for a specific IP address has expired, the script makes a new API call.  
3. Test Mode: The script provides a test mode for debugging. When an IP is in test mode, the script logs the IP as blocked regardless of the abuse score.  
4. IP Cleanup Feature: The module has an IP Cleanup feature that automatically deletes expired IP records. The cleanup process is triggered once per day by the first logged IP. This functionality can be enabled or disabled, and the IP record expiration period can be configured in the settings "IP Cleanup Period (in days)".  
5. Manual Whitelisting and Blacklisting: The script checks if an IP is manually whitelisted or blacklisted before it does anything else. Manually whitelisted IPs will bypass the AbuseIPDB check, and manually blacklisted IPs will be immediately blocked. Enter the IP addresses separated by commas without any spaces, like this: `192.168.1.1,192.168.2.2,192.168.3.3`.
6. Additional IP Blacklist File Option: The module offers an advanced IP blacklist feature. Administrators can enable or disable this functionality through the "Enable IP Blacklist File?" setting in the Zen Cart admin panel. Once enabled, the module examines a designated blacklist file for every incoming IP address. The blacklist file should list one complete or partial IP address per line. If there is a match, the corresponding IP will be promptly blocked, bypassing any other checks or scoring methods. This feature provides administrators with enhanced control over blocking specific IP addresses by utilizing complete or partial matches from the blacklist file.    
7. Logging: If logging is enabled, log files are created when an IP is blocked, whether manually or based on the AbuseIPDB score. If API logging is enabled, a separate log file is also created for API calls. The location of these log files can be configured in the `ABUSEIPDB_LOG_FILE_PATH` setting in the Zen Cart admin panel.  
8. Skipping IP Check for Known Spiders: If the "Allow Spiders?" setting (`ABUSEIPDB_SPIDER_ALLOW`) is enabled, known spiders will be skipped in the IP check and logging process, as they are not subject to AbuseIPDB scoring. This can be useful for avoiding unnecessary API calls and log entries for spider sessions.  
9. Spider Detection: The script utilizes a file called `spiders.txt` provided by Zen Cart to identify known spiders, including search engine bots and web crawlers. It reads the user agent from the HTTP request and compares it against the entries in the spiders.txt file. If a match is found, indicating that the user agent corresponds to a known spider, the spider flag is set to true. This flag determines the script's behavior, enabling it to bypass certain checks or execute specific actions tailored for spider sessions.  

10. **Enhanced "Who's Online" Page Features**  
- **Real-Time Threat Assessment**: Displays AbuseIPDB confidence scores for each visitor, enabling real-time assessment of potential threats. Clicking on a score redirects to the AbuseIPDB website for detailed information about the IP address.  
- **Interactive IP Status Icons**:  
    - üõ°Ô∏è **Red Shield**: Indicates an IP blocked due to a high AbuseIPDB score (Score Block, `SB`).  
    - üõ°Ô∏è **Purple Shield**: Indicates an IP blocked by the blacklist (IP Blacklist, `IB`).  
    - üõ°Ô∏è **Blue Shield**: Indicates an IP blocked by its country (Manual Country Block, `MC`).  
    - üõ°Ô∏è **Teal Shield**: Indicates an IP blocked due to a domestic flood (Country Flood, CF).  
    - üõ°Ô∏è **Brown Shield**: Indicates an IP blocked due to a foreign flood (Foreign Flood, FF).  
    - üõ°Ô∏è **Orange Shield**: Indicates an IP blocked due to flood detection (2-octet Flood 2F or 3-octet Flood 3F), with a superscript "2" for 2F or "3" for 3F to distinguish the flood type.  
    - üö´ **Grey Circle with Slash**: Appears for unblocked IPs with a score greater than 0, allowing quick manual addition to the blacklist file directly from the "Who's Online" screen.  
  
  A legend at the top of the "Who's Online" page explains the meaning of each active shield color, showing only the colors for features that are currently enabled. This helps admins quickly identify and manage threats.    

    **Requirements for "Who's Online" Features**  
	- Ensure the optional files `whos_online.php` and `blacklist.txt` are uploaded to your Zen Cart admin directory.  
	- To display the üö´ **Grey Circle with Slash** (blacklist button), the **"Enable IP Blacklist File"** setting must be set to `true` in the configuration.  

11. **Flood Tracking and Flood Blocking (NEW!)**  
    - Tracks IP hits by 2-octet prefixes (e.g., `192.168`), 3-octet prefixes (e.g., `192.168.1`), and country codes (e.g., `US`, `VN`), blocking IPs if thresholds are exceeded within configurable reset windows (e.g., 1/2 hour).  
    - Country and foreign (non-home country) floods use separate thresholds and minimum score settings (`ABUSEIPDB_FLOOD_COUNTRY_MIN_SCORE`, `ABUSEIPDB_FLOOD_FOREIGN_MIN_SCORE`, default 5) to prevent blocking legitimate traffic.  
    - Administrators can manually block entire countries (e.g., `VN,CN,RU`) via configuration settings for immediate protection.  

12. **Foreign Country Flood Detection (NEW!)**  
    - You can separately monitor "foreign" traffic ‚Äî meaning traffic originating outside your store‚Äôs configured home country.  
    - If hits from a foreign country exceed the configured threshold, blocking will occur automatically.  

13. **Manual Country Blocking (NEW!)**  
    - Administrators can manually specify a list of country codes to instantly block (e.g., `VN,CN,RU`) without waiting for AbuseIPDB scores or flood detection to trigger.  
    - Supports both proactive (manual) and reactive (automatic) defense strategies.  

14. **Score-Safe Flood Logic**  
    - Even if flood thresholds are crossed, an IP must meet a minimum AbuseIPDB score before blocking occurs.  
    - Ensures legitimate customers are not accidentally blocked during sudden spikes in real traffic (e.g., newsletters, sales) for your default country and foreign traffic.  

15. **Automatic API Usage Failsafe**  
    - If the AbuseIPDB API quota is exceeded, API calls fail gracefully, and cached -1 scores trigger retries to obtain valid scores.  
    - IPs with -1 scores are treated as neutral and **will not** trigger flood or country blocking, ensuring site accessibility during API unavailability.  

16. **Expanded Admin Settings**  
    - New settings added:  
      - Foreign Flood Threshold  
      - Minimum Score for Country Flood Blocking  
      - Manual Blocked Country List  
    - Provides fine-grained control over flood detection, country-level blocking, and API safety margins.  

17. **Session Rate Limiting (NEW!)**  
    - **Purpose**: Protects your site from bots that rapidly create sessions (e.g., 1000+ in a short time), which can overload the server.  
    - **How It Works**:  
      - Tracks the number of sessions an IP creates within a configurable time window (default: 100 sessions in 60 seconds).  
      - If the threshold is exceeded, the IP is queued for blocking by adding it to the `abuseipdb_actions` table, and a log entry is generated in `logs/abuseipdb_session_blocks.log` (e.g., "2025-05-24 19:05:00 - IP xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx blocked: 101 sessions in 30 seconds").  
      - The next request (from any IP) checks the `abuseipdb_actions` table, adds the queued IP to a dedicated section in your `.htaccess` file (marked by `# AbuseIPDB Session Blocks Start` and `# AbuseIPDB Session Blocks End`), removes the IP from the table, and denies the request.  
      - This queuing mechanism reduces `.htaccess` write delays by decoupling the write operation from the bot's request, ensuring faster and more reliable blocking.  
      - The block is permanent until the admin manually removes the IP from `.htaccess`.  
      - Log entries are created only for the initial block event, preventing duplicates, and are always generated regardless of whether general logging is enabled.  
    - **Server Requirements**:  
      - This feature is designed for Apache2 servers, as it relies on modifying the `.htaccess` file to block IPs.  
      - For non-Apache servers (e.g., Nginx), you‚Äôll need to implement equivalent rate-limiting mechanisms manually (e.g., using Nginx rate limiting or server-level firewalls like fail2ban).  
    - **File Permission Requirements**:  
      - The `.htaccess` file must be writable by the web server user (e.g., `www-data` or `apache`).  
      - Set the correct permissions before enabling this feature:  
        ```bash
        chmod 664 /path/to/zen-cart/.htaccess
        chmod 775 /path/to/zen-cart
        ```
      - Ensure the directory containing `.htaccess` (e.g., `/var/www/html/`) is also writable by the web server user.  
    - **Adding IPs to `.htaccess`**:  
      - The plugin automatically adds blocked IPs to a dedicated section in `.htaccess`, marked by:  
        ```
		<Files *>
        # AbuseIPDB Session Blocks Start
        Deny from <IP>
        # AbuseIPDB Session Blocks End
		</Files>
        ```
      - This section is created after the `RewriteEngine on` directive but before other rewrite rules to ensure block rules are processed early.  
      - If the section doesn‚Äôt exist, the plugin will create it during the first block event.  
    - **Manual IP Removal**:  
      - To unblock an IP, manually edit the `.htaccess` file and remove the corresponding `Deny from <IP>` line from the AbuseIPDB session blocks section.  
      - Save the file, and the IP will be able to access the site again.  
      - Note: After unblocking, the session count will continue to increment until the reset window expires (default: 300 seconds of inactivity). To immediately allow a fresh evaluation, manually reset the `session_count` and `session_window_start` for the IP in the `abuseipdb_cache` table.  
    - **Log File**:  
      - All session rate limit blocks are logged to `[log_path]/abuseipdb_session_blocks.log`, regardless of the general logging setting (`ABUSEIPDB_ENABLE_LOGGING`).  
      - Check this log to review blocked IPs and their session counts (e.g., "2025-05-24 19:05:00 - IP xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx blocked: 101 sessions in 30 seconds").  
    - **Configuration Settings**:  
      - **Enable Session Rate Limiting?**: Toggle to enable/disable the feature (default: `false`).  
      - **Session Rate Limit Threshold**: Maximum sessions allowed in the time window (default: 100).  
      - **Session Rate Limit Window (seconds)**: Time window for counting sessions (default: 60 seconds).  
      - **Session Rate Limit Reset Window (seconds)**: Time after which the session count resets if no new sessions are created (default: 300 seconds = 5 minutes).  
    - **Admin Dashboard Widget**:  
      - When enabled, the widget displays the number of IPs blocked in `.htaccess` due to session rate limiting, along with a list of recent blocks.  
      - This allows admins to quickly see if a block has occurred without manually checking logs or `.htaccess`.  

## SCRIPT LOGIC

This section provides an understanding of the logic steps involved in checking an IP and creating the corresponding log files:  

1. IP Whitelisting: The script first checks if the IP is whitelisted. If it is, the IP is permitted without further processing.  
2. Session Rate Limiting: If enabled, the script tracks the number of sessions created by the IP within a configurable time window (default: 100 sessions in 60 seconds). If the threshold is exceeded, the IP is queued for blocking by adding it to the `abuseipdb_actions` table, and a log entry is created in `abuseipdb_session_blocks.log`. The next request (from any IP) applies the block by adding the IP to `.htaccess`, removing it from the table, and denying the request, reducing write delays and preventing duplicate logs.  
3. Manual IP Blocking: If the IP is not whitelisted or blocked by session rate limiting, the script checks if the IP is manually blocked. If it is, the IP address is logged as blocked in the cache and a corresponding log file is generated. The log file creation details are as follows:  
    - File Name: `abuseipdb_blocked_cache_<date>.log`  
    - Location: `ABUSEIPDB_LOG_FILE_PATH`  
4. IP Cache Lookup: If the IP is neither whitelisted nor manually blocked, the script then looks for the IP in the database cache.  
    - a. If the IP is found in the cache and the cache has not expired:  
      - The abuse score is retrieved from the cache.  
      - If the abuse score is above the threshold or the IP is in test mode, the IP is logged as blocked in the cache and a log file is created with the same details as described above.  
    - b. If the IP is not found in the cache or the cache has expired:  
      - An API call is made to AbuseIPDB to fetch the abuse score for the IP.  
      - The database cache is then updated with the new abuse score and timestamp.  
    - c. Skip IP check for known spiders: If the IP is identified as a known spider and the ABUSEIPDB_SPIDER_ALLOW setting is enabled, the IP check and logging steps are skipped for spiders.  
    - d. Spider Logging: If Spider logging is enabled, a separate log file for spiders that bypassed an IP check is created.  
5. **Flood Tracking and Flood Blocking (NEW!)**: After an IP is cached or updated, the system automatically tracks hits against:  
    - 2-octet prefixes (e.g., `192.168`)  
    - 3-octet prefixes (e.g., `192.168.1`)  
    - Country codes (e.g., `US`, `VN`)  

	The following checks are performed in sequence:  
    - **Manual Country Blocking**: If the IP‚Äôs country code (retrieved from the cache or API) matches a manually blocked country code (e.g., `VN,CN,RU`) specified in `ABUSEIPDB_BLOCKED_COUNTRIES`, the IP is blocked immediately.  
    - **2-Octet Flood Detection**: If enabled (`ABUSEIPDB_FLOOD_2OCTET_ENABLED`), tracks hits from the IP‚Äôs 2-octet prefix (e.g., `192.168`). If the count exceeds the threshold (`ABUSEIPDB_FLOOD_2OCTET_THRESHOLD`) within the reset window (`ABUSEIPDB_FLOOD_2OCTET_RESET`), the IP is blocked.  
    - **3-Octet Flood Detection**: If enabled (`ABUSEIPDB_FLOOD_3OCTET_ENABLED`), tracks hits from the IP‚Äôs 3-octet prefix (e.g., `192.168.1`). If the count exceeds the threshold (`ABUSEIPDB_FLOOD_3OCTET_THRESHOLD`) within the reset window (`ABUSEIPDB_FLOOD_3OCTET_RESET`), the IP is blocked.  
    - **Country Flood Detection**: If enabled (`ABUSEIPDB_FLOOD_COUNTRY_ENABLED`), tracks hits from the IP‚Äôs country code (e.g., `US`). If the count exceeds the threshold (`ABUSEIPDB_FLOOD_COUNTRY_THRESHOLD`) within the reset window (`ABUSEIPDB_FLOOD_COUNTRY_RESET`), and the IP‚Äôs AbuseIPDB score meets the minimum score requirement (`ABUSEIPDB_FLOOD_COUNTRY_MIN_SCORE`, default 5), the IP is blocked.  
    - **Foreign Flood Detection**: If enabled (`ABUSEIPDB_FOREIGN_FLOOD_ENABLED`), and the IP‚Äôs country code does not match the store‚Äôs default country (`ABUSEIPDB_DEFAULT_COUNTRY`), tracks hits from the foreign country. If the count exceeds the foreign threshold (`ABUSEIPDB_FOREIGN_FLOOD_THRESHOLD`) within the reset window (`ABUSEIPDB_FLOOD_FOREIGN_RESET`), and the IP‚Äôs AbuseIPDB score meets the minimum score requirement (`ABUSEIPDB_FLOOD_FOREIGN_MIN_SCORE`, default 5), the IP is blocked.  

    Additional behavior:  
    - **Score-Safe Rule**: Even if a flood is detected, an IP is only blocked if its AbuseIPDB score meets or exceeds the configured **minimum score threshold** (applies to country and foreign flood detection).  
    - **API Fail-Safe**: IPs returning an AbuseIPDB score of `-1` (e.g., when the API limit is reached) are treated as **neutral** and will not trigger flood or country-based blocking.  

    **Flood Reset Logic:**  
    - Each prefix or country has an individual timestamp.  
    - If the **timestamp is older** than the reset window (e.g., 1 hour), the count is **reset to 1** and the timestamp is refreshed.  
    - If the timestamp is **within** the reset window, the count is **incremented**.  
    - Blocking only occurs if the threshold is met **within the same reset window**.  
    - Example: If the threshold is set to 50 hits per hour for the 2-octet prefix `192.168`, once 50 visits are recorded within a single hour, that range will be **blocked immediately**.  
      The block remains in place **until a full hour passes** with **no new visits** from that prefix.  
      If even one additional hit occurs during that hour, the reset timer is extended ‚Äî keeping the range blocked.
6. Database Cleanup: The script's function periodically removes old IP records from the database when triggered, if the cleanup feature is enabled. This operation is performed only once per day, as indicated by the update of the maintenance timestamp.  
7. API Logging: If API logging is enabled, a separate log file for API calls is created. The log file creation details are as follows:  
    - File Name: `abuseipdb_api_call_<date>.log`  
    - Location: `ABUSEIPDB_LOG_FILE_PATH`  
8. IP Blocking: If the abuse score is above the threshold or the IP is in test mode, the IP address is logged as blocked (either from the API call or from the cache) and a corresponding log file is created. The log file creation details are as follows:  
    - File Name: `abuseipdb_blocked_<date>.log`  
    - Location: `ABUSEIPDB_LOG_FILE_PATH`  
9. Safe IP: If none of the above conditions trigger a block, the IP is considered safe, and the script proceeds without further action.
